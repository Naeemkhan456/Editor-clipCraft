# Mobile App Conversion Plan

## Steps to Convert Web App to Mobile App using Capacitor

1. [x] Install Capacitor dependencies
2. [x] Initialize Capacitor in the project
3. [x] Configure Capacitor for Android and iOS
4. [x] Update Vite configuration for mobile compatibility
5. [x] Build the web app
6. [x] Sync with Capacitor
7. [ ] Test on Android and iOS

## Current Status: Ready for mobile testing

## Backend Deployment Solution:
Your backend is currently using in-memory storage (MemStorage) and needs to be deployed separately from the frontend. I've created a `railway.toml` file for deploying your backend to Railway.

## Next Steps:

### For Backend Deployment:
1. Create a Railway account at https://railway.app
2. Install Railway CLI: `npm i -g @railway/cli`
3. Deploy backend: `railway deploy`
4. Get your backend URL from Railway dashboard
5. Update frontend API URLs to point to your Railway backend

### For Android Testing:
1. Install Android Studio
2. Open the `android` folder in Android Studio
3. Build and run on an Android device/emulator

### For iOS Testing:
1. Install Xcode
2. Open the `ios` folder in Xcode
3. Build and run on an iOS device/simulator

### Commands to run:
- `npx cap open android` - Opens Android project
- `npx cap open ios` - Opens iOS project
- `npx cap run android` - Runs on Android (if connected)
- `npx cap run ios` - Runs on iOS (if connected)

## Production URLs:
- Frontend: https://editor-clipcraft.netlify.app
- Backend: https://editor-clipcraft-production.up.railway.app
